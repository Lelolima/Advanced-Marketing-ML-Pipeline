#### Key Features

1. **Data Generation and Validation:**
   - Creates synthetic datasets with behavioral, financial, and demographic features.
   - Includes rigorous validation checks to ensure data integrity.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handles outliers using the IQR method.
   - Scales numeric data and encodes categorical variables with a robust preprocessing pipeline.

3. **Machine Learning Models:**
   - Classification with XGBoost for customer conversion prediction.
   - Regression using Gradient Boosting for revenue estimation.
   - Hyperparameter optimization via GridSearchCV.

4. **Clustering and Segmentation:**
   - Customer segmentation using KMeans clustering.
   - Computes silhouette scores to validate segmentation quality.

5. **Evaluation Metrics:**
   - Generates detailed classification reports and calculates Mean Squared Error (MSE).
   - Cross-validation ensures robust model performance.

6. **Interactive Visualizations:**
   - Integrates Plotly for dynamic data visualizations.
   - Designed for use with Streamlit, enabling user-friendly dashboards.

7. **Model Automation and Logging:**
   - Tracks experiments, metrics, and model versions with MLflow.
   - Ensures reproducibility and efficient model management.
